# Robinhood-Auto-Trader #
See the README.txt until the system is finished

If you want to play with this, install robin_stocks first: https://github.com/jmfernandes/robin_stocks

Also, I built a simulator called "Slingshot" - based on this strategy so you can see how powerful this type of trading is on totally random price behavior: https://triphiusfire.nz/slingshot-simulator.html
