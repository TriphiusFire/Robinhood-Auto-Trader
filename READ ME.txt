RATs V1
Robinhood Auto Traders

Includes two separate trading bots
- stockRAT 
- cryptoRAT

---How to use--- 
1. decide how much money you want to spend each time you buy.
2. Manually buy all the stocks you want the autotraders to trade and record the price you bought each stock at
3. Record the symbols and first buy prices in the rh_stock_data.json or rh_crypto_data.json
4. If your account is small, less than day trading requirements, run this only once per day. 
   With a big day trading account, run as many times as you want.

---JSON - how to---
all data inside curly braces		---> {}
all key pairs separated by comma: 	---> {pair1,pair2,pair3}
all pairs take form: 			--->  symbol : buyprice
all symbols capital and in quotes:	---> "SYM"
all prices without quotes 		---> 150.0

example:
{
	"SYM1": 5.53,
	"SYM2": 79.11,
	"SYM3": 428.01

pyinstaller installed via pip

if errors found, check py file code and recompile with pyinstaller

pyinstaller exe's flag windows defender with "wacatac" trojan.
this is *likely* a false positive
where i've read about this online everyone says "please tell your antivirus company to stop flagging this because its not true"

personally, i don't have the know-how to verify this for myself

if you are unwilling to take the risk for yourself, do not use the exe files, just use python for the _RAT.py files
